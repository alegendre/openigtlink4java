Java library for OpenIGTLink protocol.
The OpenIGTLink protocol is a simple but extensible data format to transfer various types of data
among software and devices used in image-guided therapy (IGT) scene e.g. surgical navigation software,
tracking device, robotic device, imaging scanner. The protocol can handle image, tracking data, transform, device control
and monitoring command, and other user-defined data types.
It is designed to work in the application layer of the TCP/IP stack, but not limited to it;
developers can use this protocol with UDP/IP or other network protocol models.
3D Slicer' supports OpenIGTLink and has interface module as OpenIGTLinkIF, which is currently available in 3D
